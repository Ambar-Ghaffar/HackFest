# Android Kotlin - "Relative Layout"
### Relative layout is a viewgroup which is used for holding views in it which are positioned relative to each other.

RelativeLayout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions. The position of each view can be specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of or below another view) or in positions relative to the parent RelativeLayout area (such as aligned to the bottom, left or center).

#### So before diving into Relative Layout first we will see what is a View Group.

<hr/>
When you are making an app there are multiple Views in it, there could be a TextView and an ImageView and etc. <br />
Every View has a relationship with each other, for example:-
  an image may be next to some text, and buttons may form a row. 
  

#### A ViewGroup is a container that View objects can sit in, and is responsible for arranging the Views inside it. <br /><br /> The arrangement, or layout, can change depending on the size and aspect ratio of the screen of the Android device that the app is running on, and the layout can adapt to whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode.


# Positioning Views in Relative Layout

Unlike in Linear Layout where we have an Idea that the views will be either horizontally or vertically stacked in the order of their definition, views in Relative Layout have no predefined order.
The position of the views are defined relative to that of parent of sibling views. RelativeLayout lets child views specify their position relative to the parent view or to each other (specified by ID). So you can align two elements by right border, or make one below another, centered in the screen, centered left, and so on. By default, all child views are drawn at the top-left of the layout, so you must define the position of each view using the various layout properties available from RelativeLayout.LayoutParams .

**Some of the many layout properties available to views in a RelativeLayout include:**
* **android:layout_alignParentTop** : If "true", makes the top edge of this view match the top edge of the parent.
* **android:layout_centerVertical** : If "true", centers this child vertically within its parent.
* **android:layout_below** : Positions the top edge of this view below the view specified with a resource ID.
* **android:layout_toRightOf** : Positions the left edge of this view to the right of the view specified with a resource ID.
